# MachineLearningFinalProject
# Introduction 
The dataset that was chosen for this final project is titled “Paris Housing Classification” found on Kaggle. This dataset includes 10,000 data points for 18 different features. Using various machine learning approaches learned in class, the goal was to be able to classify whether the different houses from the dataset were considered “basic” or “luxury”. These concepts were computed using python in Google Collaboratory.

Shown below is a snippet of the code used to print the dataset used and to check to see if there are any missing values in the dataset:
